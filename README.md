The topic of this website is a sneaker purchasing website. The website is called “Sneaker Trend Co.” The whole idea takes inspiration from both HypeBeast and StockX, where sneaker culture and sneaker trading have become a prominent aspect of today’s world. Hoping to merge my passion for streetwear and programming, I found this website a joy to make. The tag line is “the ultimate sneaker marketplace” which reflects the overall purpose of the website.
